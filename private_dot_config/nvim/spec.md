## 1.1 Layout

- ~/.config/nvim: the config root folder
  - init.lua: enables vim.loader for faster startup, then requires these files directly, in order:
    1. craftzdog.utils, assigned to the global Craftzdog
    2. craftzdog.config.options, .keymaps, .autocmds, .commands, .workarounds
    3. craftzdog.plugins
  - lua/craftzdog/: my config lives here
    - utils/: shared helpers
      - init.lua: returns a table of helper modules, empty for now.
        - Later steps add modules like utils/editor.lua, exposed as editor.
    - config/: plain Neovim settings, one file per name above
    - plugins/:
      - init.lua: installs every plugin in one vim.pack.add call, then requires each group file
      - Each plugin group gets its own file next to it (e.g. ui.lua), which configures its plugins with require `require("<plugin>").setup({ ... })`
      - keymaps.lua: every keymap that uses a plugin, required last so all plugins are set up first. Group files hold no keymaps.
- Lua files are indented with tabs, formatted by stylua with its defaults.

## 1.2 Leader and basics

- Leader and local leader are `Space`.
- Mouse is off. Keyboard-only.
- Clipboard is `unnamedplus`, so yank and paste go through the system clipboard.
- Indent is **2 spaces**:
  - tabstop, shiftwidth, and softtabstop are all 2
  - expandtab and smartindent are on
- `-` counts as part of a word, so foo-bar is one word.
  - Fits CSS classes and kebab-case names.

## 1.3 Look of the buffer

- Hybrid line numbers: number + relativenumber on, so the cursor line shows its real number.
- cursorline on. No wrap, scrolloff 10, sidescrolloff 8.
- signcolumn always on.
  - Text doesn't jump when git or diagnostic marks appear.
- cmdheight 0 and one global statusline (laststatus 3).
  - Maximizes vertical space.
- Rounded borders on every float (winborder).
- Popup menu: at most 10 rows, slightly see-through (pumheight 10, pumblend 10).
- Matching brackets flash briefly (showmatch on, matchtime 2).
- title on, so the terminal tab shows the file name.
- Diagonal ╱ fill in empty diff areas.

## 1.4 Search, files, undo

- ignorecase + smartcase on: case-insensitive until a capital letter is typed.
- path adds **, so :find searches subfolders.
- : completion:
  - wildmode is longest:full,full
  - wildignore skips _/node_modules/_, *.o, *.obj, *.pyc, *.class, *.jar
- swapfile and writebackup off.
- Persistent undo (undofile on) lives in ~/.cache/nvim/undodir.
  - Undo survives closing the file. Swap files only get in the way.
- Snappier timing: updatetime 300, timeoutlen 500, ttimeoutlen 0.
  - Faster CursorHold events, and key sequences resolve without lag.

## 1.5 Splits and folds

- New splits open below and to the right.
- Folds come from Treesitter, with foldlevel 99.
  - Everything starts unfolded, and folds can still be closed by syntax.

## 1.6 Messages

Neovim 0.12's experimental ui2 handles messages. It's turned on at the end of config/options.lua.

- Short messages: corner popup up to 30% of the screen tall, gone after 5 seconds.
- Long output (errors, :ls, :verbose, shell commands, progress): a scrollable pager up to half the screen.
- Search count, search pattern, completion, : completion list, and confirm prompts stay in the command line.
- Output of a command I type goes to the command line too, whatever its kind.
  - It expands over the bottom of the screen until the next key.
  - Enter moves it into the pager.
    https://github.com/rachartier/tiny-cmdline.nvim?ref=devas.life shows the : command line as a floating box, centered left to right, 20% from the top. It's set up in plugins/ui.lua.
    step
- With cmdheight 0, the command line needs somewhere to appear, and near the top is where the eyes already are.

## 1.7 Autocmds

- Yanked text flashes briefly.
- Only the active window shows the cursorline.

## 1.8 Core keymaps

## 1.9

- <leader>bd closes every hidden buffer, except unsaved ones.

# 2. Look and feel

## 2.1 Colorscheme

- https://github.com/craftzdog/solarized-osaka.nvim?ref=devas.life, vivid style, transparent background.
  - The terminal's blur shows through, and the palette matches the Ghostty theme.

## 2.2 Icons

- https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.icons?ref=devas.life, also mocking https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons?ref=devas.life.
  - One icon source for every plugin.

## 2.3 Tabline

A custom tabline in utils/tabline.lua, with no plugin.

- Shown only when there are 2 or more tabs.

- Each tab shows the active window's file name with its icon, padded with 3 spaces, between slanted separators.

  - Both edges slant outward going down, so each tab is a trapezoid, wider at the bottom:

- Colors from the solarized-osaka palette:

  - Active tab: bold base4 text on yellow
  - Inactive tab: base0 on base02
  - The icon takes the tab's text color.
  - The separators take the tab's color on a transparent background, and so does the empty area after the last tab.

- Names longer than 20 characters are cut to 17 plus ….

- Unsaved tabs show [+] before the icon.

- Terminals show [Terminal] and empty buffers [No Name], with no icon.

## 2.4 Statusline

[lualine](#https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim?ref=devas.life), one global bar, theme `auto`.

| SECTION | CONTENT                                                                       |
| :------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| a       | Mode                                                                          |
| b       | Git branch                                                                    |
| c       | Project root name (only when it differs from cwd), filetype icon, pretty path |
| x       | Macro recording register, diagnostics, git diff counts                        |
| y       | Progress                                                                      |
| z       | line:column                                                                   |

- The project root is found by searching upward for `.git`, `lua`, `package.json`, `Makefile`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, or `pyproject.toml`.
- Refreshes on cursor move and macro start/stop.
  - The recording indicator replaces the hidden command line.

## 2.5 Window labels

- incline.nvim shows a filename tag with an icon in the top-right corner of each window, plus [+] when unsaved.
  - With a single global statusline, each split still needs to say which file it holds.
- The tag hides when the cursor reaches its line.

## 2.6 Snacks

snacks.nvim provides the notifier, indent guides, statuscolumn, and word highlighting.
Later steps turn on more of it, like the picker and the lazygit integration.

- Words: the word under the cursor is highlighted everywhere. ]] / [[ jump between occurrences.
  - It needs a language server, so it works after step 5.1.
- Smooth scroll is off.
  - Scrolling should feel instant.

# 3. Navigating

## 3.1 Picker

The snacks.nvim picker

The _snacks.nvim_ picker.

| KEYS | ACTION                             | NOTES                                                                  |
| :--- | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `;f` | Finds files, including hidden and ignored ones | Dotfiles like `.github/`, `.env`, and `.env.example` are part of real projects. |
| `;r` | Live-greps, including hidden and ignored files |                                                                        |
| `;;` | Reopens the last picker            |                                                                        |
| `\\` | Lists open buffers                 | Jumps to a window that already shows the buffer.                       |
| `;e` | Lists diagnostics                  |                                                                        |
| `;n` | Shows notification history         |                                                                        |
| `;h` | Lists git hunks                    |                                                                        |

## 3.2 File explorer

oil.nvim replaces netrw and shows hidden files.

- The directory is a buffer, so renaming, moving, and deleting files is plain text editing followed by :w.
- Columns: icon, permissions, size, modified time.
- Renaming a file asks the LSP to update imports and saves those edits automatically.
- In the tabline (2.3), an oil tab shows its directory (~/foo) with no icon.
  - Paths longer than 20 characters are cut from the left to … plus the last 17.
    | KEYS | ACTION                                            | NOTES                                              |
    | :--- | :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------- |
    | `sf` | Opens oil as a centered float with a live preview | At most **200** columns wide, with rounded corners |
    | `h`  | Goes to the parent directory                      |                                                    |
    | `q`  | Closes oil                                        |                                                    |

# 4. Syntax

## 4.1 Treesitter

https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter?ref=devas.life, main branch

- Ensures 38 parsers:
  - astro, bash, c, cmake, cpp, css, diff, fish, gitignore, go, graphql, html, http, java, javascript, jsdoc, json, lua, luadoc, luap, markdown, markdown_inline, php, printf, python, query, regex, rust, scss, sql, svelte, toml, tsx, typescript, vim, vimdoc, xml, yaml
- A FileType autocmd starts highlighting and Treesitter indent whenever a parser exists.
- :TSUpdate runs on the PackChanged event.
  - Parsers stay in sync with the plugin version.

## 4.2 Small highlights

- todo-comments.nvim highlights TODO, FIXME, and the like, with defaults.
- nvim-highlight-colors paints hex, rgb, hsl, ANSI, and CSS variable colors as backgrounds.
  - Neovim's LSP document colors are turned off, so colors aren't painted twice.

# 5. Code smarts

## 5.1 Language servers

Mason + mason-tool-installer install on start, and never auto-update:

- Servers: lua-language-server, vtsls, eslint-lsp, oxlint, tailwindcss-language-server, css-lsp, rust-analyzer, copilot-language-server
- Formatters: prettier, prettierd, oxfmt, stylua, shfmt
  nvim-lspconfig supplies defaults.

- Servers are turned on with vim.lsp.enable: eslint, oxlint, lua_ls, cssls, vtsls, tailwindcss, rust_analyzer.
- Every server gets file-rename support (didRename / willRename).

## 5.2 Diagnostics look

- Underlined, not updated while typing, sorted by severity.
- Inline text: ● message, with the source only when there are several.
- Gutter icons come from the shared icon set.
  For example, typing const x: number = 'a' in a TSX file:

- The error is underlined, with ● Type 'string' is not assignable… inline and an icon in the gutter.
- The line also has a "never read" hint, but the gutter shows the error icon, since they are sorted by severity.
- oxlint flags the unused x too, so each message shows its source (ts, oxc).

## 5.3 Per-server settings

Per-server settings live in after/lsp/<name>.lua.
Neovim 0.12 merges these automatically, so there's no setup boilerplate.

- vtsls:
  - Uses the workspace TypeScript and updates imports on file move.
  - Server-side fuzzy matching and function-call completion.
  - Inlay hints are short: no variable types, 30 characters max.
- lua_ls: knows the Neovim runtime, shows param-type hints, silences a few noisy checks.
  - cssls: ignores empty rules.
  - oxlint: starts with oxlint --lsp.

## 5.4 Completion

blink.cmp, version ^1, enter preset: Enter accepts.

- Every language server from 5.1 also gets blink.cmp's completion capabilities.
- Auto-brackets after functions. Docs pop up after 200 ms.
- Menu items are colorized by Treesitter, with kind icons from the shared icon set.
- Ghost text is off.
  - Copilot already shows inline suggestions, and two ghost texts would clash.
- In the command line, the menu opens by itself for : commands only, with nothing preselected.

## 5.5 Pairs

https://github.com/nvim-mini/mini.pairs?ref=devas.life, with defaults, in insert and command mode.

## 5.6 Formatting

https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim?ref=devas.life formats on save with a **1000ms** timeout, falling back to the LSP

| FILETYPES                                                          | FORMATTER                                              |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| js, ts, jsx, tsx, json, css, scss, less, html, markdown, mdx, yaml | oxfmt, then prettierd, then prettier (first available) |
| lua                                                                | stylua                                                 |
| sh                                                                 | shfmt                                                  |
| fish                                                               | fish_indent                                            |

- oxfmt runs only when the project has an oxfmt config, like .oxfmtrc.json or a Vite+ vite.config.ts.
  - Projects using prettier keep their own formatter.
- :ToggleFormatter turns format-on-save off or back on for the current buffer, with a notification.
  - The command lives in config/commands.lua.

### 5.7 LSP keymaps

# 6. Git

## 6.1 Signs and blame

https://github.com/lewis6991/gitsigns.nvim?ref=devas.life with defaults

| KEYS         | ACTION                                                                   | NOTES                                                          |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<leader>gb` | Blames the line                                                          |                                                                |
| `<leader>gB` | Blames the buffer                                                        |                                                                |
| `<leader>go` | Opens the file as of the commit that last touched the line, in a new tab | Shows the context of an old change without leaving the editor. |
| `<leader>gs` | Stages the buffer, or unstages it if nothing is left to stage            |                                                                |
| `<leader>gh` | Stages or unstages the hunk                                              |                                                                |

## 6.2 Diff overlay

- The fork groups changes into whole hunks, the way git diff shows them.

| KEYS         | ACTION              |
| :----------- | :------------------ |
| `<leader>gd` | Toggles the overlay |     |
| `]c / [c`    | Jump between hunks  |     |

## 6.3 Diff view

codediff.nvim for side-by-side diffs and history.
I use it when my agent makes a lot of changes in the codebase.

- Explorer: tree view, 50 columns wide, opens files as the cursor moves, shows +/- line stats.
- Compact mode: only changes plus 8 context lines, with folds synced across panes.

| KEYS         | ACTION                           |
| :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| `<leader>dv` | Toggles the diff view            |
| `<leader>dh` | Shows the current file's history |
| `<leader>dH` | Shows the repo history           |

## 6.4 Lazygit

;g opens https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit?ref=devas.life in a float through snacks.nvim, with the theme synced and the active border in the WarningMsg color.

Pressing e on a file closes lazygit and opens the file in the window it was launched from, through $NVIM and nvim --server --remote.

- ;g remembers the current window.
- e quits lazygit, focuses that window with --remote-send, then opens the file, so the cursor ends up in the file.
- Not a new tab and not a nested Neovim. Outside Neovim, it just runs nvim <file>.
- The edit command is written in bash/POSIX syntax.

Lazygit's own config lives in ~/.config/lazygit/config.yml, outside the Neovim config. snacks.nvim loads it together with the synced theme. It holds:

- Diffs render with delta --dark --paging=never --syntax-theme="Solarized (dark)".
- Mouse events are off and auto-fetch is off.
- C in the files panel commits with commitizen (git cz).

## 6.5 Links

https://github.com/linrongbin16/gitlinker.nvim?ref=devas.life : :GitLink copies a GitHub URL for the current line, or the selected range.

# 7. AI

## 7.1 Copilot

https://github.com/zbirenbaum/copilot.lua?ref=devas.life with auto-trigger on, enabled in Markdown and help too

- Notes and docs benefit from suggestions as much as code does.
- Requires :Copilot auth once.
- On macOS, the terminal needs Option as Alt.

The keys work in insert mode:

| KEYS              | ACTION                   |
| :---------------- | :----------------------- |
| `<c-l>`           | Accepts the suggestion   |
| `Alt-l`           | Accepts a word           |
| `Alt-Shift-l`     | Accepts a line           |
| `Alt-]` / `Alt-[` | Cycle suggestions        |
| `<c-]>`           | Dismisses the suggestion |

# 8 Agentic coding

## 8.1 Copy paths for agents

| KEYS         | ACTION                                                         | NOTES                                       |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| `<leader>yf` | Copies the current file's path relative to cwd with `#L<line>` | e.g. `lua/craftzdog/config/options.lua#L12` |
| `<leader>yp` | Copies the absolute path the same way                          |                                             |

- Both show the copied text in a notification.
  - Pasting the path into an agent's prompt points it at the exact line.

## 8.2 Helper keymaps

| KEYS                  | ACTION                                                                                        | NOTES                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<leader>cc` (visual) | Copies the selection as a Markdown code block with `filename="..."` and `line=...` attributes | The same format Inkdrop uses for code-block attributes. Short language names (`tsx`, `jsx`, `ts`, `js`). |
| `<leader>j`           | Opens the project's `package.json` in a centered **80%** float. `q` or `Esc` closes it.       |                                                                                                          |
